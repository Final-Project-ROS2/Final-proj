🔹 Improved MIT-Style Pipeline

Here’s a cleaner design:

RGB-D → Grounding-DINO (open-vocab detection + labels) → GraspNet (6D grasps on whole scene) → Scene Graph Construction (objects, grasps, relations, affordances) → Task Planner (reasoning about which grasp to use)

🔸 Why this is better

Fewer models (Grounding-DINO instead of YOLO+SAM+CLIP).

Maintain 3D context (GraspNet works on full RGB-D).

Scene graph abstraction — instead of just annotated images, you build a graph:

Nodes = objects

Edges = spatial relations (“left of”, “on top of”)

Attributes = grasps, affordances, tags

Planner-ready — graph can feed into a robot planner (pick-and-place, rearrange, etc.).

🔸 Example Flow (Output Images + Data)

Input RGB-D → RGB + grayscale depth.

Grounding-DINO → bounding boxes with text labels.

GraspNet → grasps projected in 3D, associated with objects.

Scene Graph → a visual map showing objects + relations + grasps.

Planner (optional) → chooses optimal grasp for a task (not just any grasp).



🔹 Typical RGB-D Input Files

RGB image (standard JPG/PNG)

Shape: (H, W, 3)

3 color channels (uint8, 0–255).

Example: rgb.png

Depth map (grayscale, aligned to RGB)

Shape: (H, W)

1 channel (float32 or uint16).

Each pixel = distance from camera (in meters or millimeters).

Example: depth.png or depth.exr

🔹 How They Work Together

Both files represent the same scene with the same resolution.

For pixel (x, y) →

rgb[y, x] = color

depth[y, x] = distance

So, if your pipeline reads them together:

rgb = cv2.imread("rgb.png")               # (H, W, 3)
depth = cv2.imread("depth.png", -1)       # (H, W) 16-bit or float

🔹 Alternatives

Some datasets (like GraspNet) store them in HDF5 / npz bundles (RGB + Depth + masks in one file).

RealSense SDK can output .bag video streams (RGB + depth frames).

For your project, 2 separate aligned files (RGB + Depth) is easiest to manage and explain in a progress report.


RGB-D → DINO (object detection/segmentation) → CLIP (semantic tags) → GraspNet (6D grasps) → Scene Understanding

Let’s walk through how each step should look visually with DINO instead of SAM/YOLO:

1. Input (RGB-D)

RGB image (normal scene).

Depth map (grayscale: dark = close, bright = far).

📸 Visualization: Show them side-by-side (color photo + depth).

2. DINO (DETR-style detector)

DINO outputs bounding boxes + segmentation masks directly from the RGB.

Visualization: RGB image with clean bounding boxes (and optionally masks) around objects.

E.g., a red rectangle around a “cup”, a blue one around a “laptop”.

📸 Visualization: Looks similar to YOLO, but DINO boxes are often tighter and can also include masks.

3. CLIP (Semantic Tagging)

Takes each cropped region from DINO and predicts the best semantic tag.

Visualization: bounding boxes from DINO now labeled with text.

Example:

[ Bottle ] 
[ Laptop ]
[ Mouse ]


📸 Visualization: RGB image with boxes + text tags on each object.

4. GraspNet (6D Grasp Prediction)

Uses RGB + Depth around each detected object to predict grasp poses.

Visualization:

2D projection of grasp rectangles over the object (like small “gripper jaws” drawn on top).

Colors can indicate grasp confidence (green = high, red = low).

📸 Visualization: RGB image with multiple grasp rectangles over the object regions.

5. Scene Understanding

Combines detection + CLIP tags + grasp candidates to build a structured representation.

Visualization options:

3D scene view: point cloud with bounding boxes around objects.

Scene graph: nodes = objects, edges = relations (“cup on table”, “mouse next to laptop”).

📸 Visualization: Either a 3D reconstructed scene with labeled objects, or a diagram showing object relations.

✅ So your DINO-based pipeline visuals would look like:

RGB + Depth (input).

RGB with DINO boxes/masks.

RGB with DINO boxes + CLIP tags.

RGB with grasp rectangles overlayed.

3D scene or object-relation graph.
