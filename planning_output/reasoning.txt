The image describes a classic block-stacking scenario with a flat base and four distinct blocks (A, B, C, D). Block D is initially stacked on Block C, while A, B, and C are on the base. The task is to move Block D from Block C to Block B.

**Domain Design:**
*   **Types:** I've defined `block` for the movable objects and `surface` for the static base.
*   **Predicates:**
    *   `(on ?b1 - block ?b2 - block)`: Represents `b1` being directly on top of `b2`.
    *   `(on-table ?b - block)`: Represents `b` being directly on the main supporting surface (the table/base).
    *   `(clear ?b - block)`: Indicates that the top surface of `b` is free, meaning no other block is on it.
    *   `(handempty)`: Signifies that the robot's gripper is not holding any block.
    *   `(holding ?b - block)`: Signifies that the robot's gripper is currently holding `b`.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `pick-up-from-table`: Allows the robot to pick up a `clear` block that is `on-table` when its `handempty`.
    *   `pick-up-from-block`: Allows the robot to pick up a `clear` block that is `on` another block when its `handempty`. This action also makes the block it was on `clear`.
    *   `put-down-on-table`: Allows the robot to place a `holding` block onto the table, making the block `on-table` and `clear`.
    *   `stack-on-block`: Allows the robot to place a `holding` block onto a `clear` target block, making the target block no longer `clear` and the placed block `clear`.

**Problem Design:**
*   **Objects:** All blocks (a, b, c, d) are declared as `block` type, and the base is declared as `table` of `surface` type.
*   **Initial State:**
    *   Blocks A, B, and C are `on-table`.
    *   Block D is `on` Block C.
    *   Blocks A, B, and D are `clear` (nothing on top of them). Block C is not `clear` because D is on it.
    *   The robot's `handempty`.
*   **Goal State:**
    *   Block D is `on` Block B.

This setup provides the necessary elements for a planner to find a sequence of actions to achieve the goal.
